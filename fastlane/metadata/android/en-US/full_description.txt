PeerTube is a federated video streaming platform that is community-owned and ad-free, with no vendor lock-in. This client allows you to watch and browse videos on a server of your choice in the PeerTube network.

This client comes preconfigured with one PeerTube server managed by the application creator - not the PeerTube project itself, which lists more on http://instances.joinpeertube.org/ - to allow you to have a taste of what the client is capable of. Choose your server to tune your experience!

Please note this is app is in beta and is still missing a lot of features.
